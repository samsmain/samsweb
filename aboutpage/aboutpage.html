  		<p> Growing up as a first-gen Latina, I've always been pushed to pursue my dreams. Currently attending UC Irvine as an upcoming Junior, I've discovered many different cultures and found new passions within the school. UCI has allowed me to dive into my culture further through joining UCI's folklorico group (BFDUCI). Although the past years in my college experience haven't always been easy, finding BFDUCI was key in allowing me to find others in my culture away from home. Learning to dance with the many cultural groups in Mexico, from Baja to Oaxaca, has given me a deeper understanding of the vast cultures in Mexico. I was able to deepen my Mexican roots by becoming a performer and learning new dances, which correlates to the many different states of Mexico. One of the fondest memories I have is putting on Baja's bright pink shirts and performing in UCI's DÃ­a de Los Muertos event. More recently, we performed our biggest showcase during Spring, where I was able to be part of the Oaxaca region. BFDUCI has not only been a place to learn about the rich dances of Mexico but also served as a safe space. I was able to freely express myself in Spanish with other dancers and learn about their experiences growing up as Latinos. Hence, photography was a key passion of mine to be able to encapsulate these memories and look back on the many performances and friends I've made in BFDUCI. More importantly, as the last quarter at UCI would unfortunately not allow me to continue BFDUCI,  having those photos is such an important detail to look back on.
