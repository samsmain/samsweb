				<h1> Summary </h1>
				<p> Sam is currently an incoming third-year student at the University of California, Irvine. Growing up in Los Angeles, California, Sam was enriched in various cultures, experiencing them from a visual perspective, to music, and even eating, she has always been fond of LA. Although Sam had to move to UCI, she struggled to maintain her cultural roots in a very different environment. Luckily, UCI had various cultural clubs to allow anyone to explore. There she found others like her hoping to make life-lasting friendships, more importantly, UCI Folklorico is what truly shaped her experience at UCI!   </p>
